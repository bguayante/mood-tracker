#### Find what makes you happy.


### Description

mood-tracker is an app intended to allow users to see the effects of their activities and behavior on their overall wellbeing (mood). Users may choose whatever "trackables" they feel are important to their lives. At regular intervals, users are prompted to complete a short survey asking about their mood as well as the activities they have chosen. When sufficient data has been collected, it will be possible to create custom visualizations that will enable users to see patterns in how their behavior effects their mood.


### Tech

mood-tracker employs React and Material-UI on the frontend and Node, Express, Mongoose, and MongDB on the backend. 

In the future, the webapp will be enclosed in a wrapper to create a native app to leverage the functionality of notifications to prompt users when it is time to complete a log entry. (Disclosure: this is a naive idea that has not yet been fully explored.)


### Current State

mood-tracker is very much still in development. Backend functionality is in place, but work on frontend UI and logic is currently in process.
